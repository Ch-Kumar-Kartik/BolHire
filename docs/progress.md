## MVP 0, Task 3: Browser Audio Recording

Status: implemented with automated checks passed. Manual browser microphone verification is required for the local environment.

Implemented:

- Browser microphone recording through `getUserMedia` and Web Audio.
- Genuine linear resampling to mono 16 kHz samples before WAV encoding.
- Local mono 16-bit PCM WAV playback, a 30-second capture cap, and a 2 MB output guard.
- Recorder state, duration, permission and browser-support errors, plus cleanup of tracks, audio contexts, and object URLs.
- Dependency-free Node tests for resampling, WAV headers, PCM encoding, duration, and size limits.
- A Brave and Chromium initialization repair: the recorder resets its mounted flag during React Strict Mode effect setup, supports cancelling initialization, bounds `AudioContext.resume()`, and writes development-only stage diagnostics without audio data.
- Start latency repair: the UI enters Recording after the first captured callback, skips `AudioContext.resume()` when already running, times out if no samples arrive, and uses a 2048-frame capture buffer. Development logs include a `performance.now()` breakdown for microphone acquisition, audio setup, first sample, and React commit. Fake Chromium timing improved from 111.4/72.9 ms to 69.0/17.6 ms for first/repeated starts; real device timing still needs verification.
- A local fake-microphone Chromium check verified repeated Start/Stop and rapid Start/Cancel returned the UI to Ready without retaining cancelled audio.

Validation commands:

```sh
cd frontend && npm test
cd frontend && npm run build
```

Outstanding MVP 0 work begins at Task 4: the mock voice upload pipeline. No audio is uploaded, and no STT, TTS, real LLM, Gnani, database, authentication, or deployment infrastructure has been implemented.

## MVP 0, Task 2: Text Conversation Pipeline

Status: complete and validated locally.

Implemented:

- `POST /api/v1/chat/text` with Pydantic request and response models.
- Deterministic local mock LLM with no network or credentials.
- Single-process, in-memory session history, lazy 30-minute expiry, 20-exchange cap, and per-session request serialization.
- Stable JSON error envelopes for malformed requests, validation errors, missing or expired sessions, and mock-provider failures.
- Automated tests for the text pipeline and the health endpoint.

## MVP 0, Task 1: Scaffold

Status: complete and validated locally.

Implemented:

- React, Vite, and TypeScript frontend shell with plain CSS.
- FastAPI application with `GET /api/v1/health` returning `{"status":"ok"}`.
- Pytest and HTTPX health endpoint test.
- Root development configuration and ignore rules.

Validation commands:

```sh
cd frontend && npm run build
cd frontend && npm test
cd backend && uv run pytest
```

Local development:

```sh
# Terminal 1
cd backend && uv sync && uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Terminal 2
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```
